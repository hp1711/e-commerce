maintain proper disipline. 



            Handle pressure, In college,theres no pressure for completation of assignment , mannual until submission date comes near.
that doesnt teach us to handle pressure. in comapany, it teaches us to handle pressure as theres tension to complete the task before deadline, 
if something is not working OR have no idea to do for the task, it creates pressure on us and also help up to think strong in pressure.
 also it difficults to handle it in begining level.

in company ,there's proper environment in comapany in which we've to fit/adjust.
